    <p class="text__font-size--18 text--bold spacing__margin-bottom--2">Sixth Edge had the opportunity to work with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) through a grant awarded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to build a platform for a network of 25 Universities around North America. The platform provided a place to share resources, create learning communities, and offer courses to current and future STEM faculty committed to advancing evidence-based teaching practices. Since the initial grant the Network has expanded to more than 40 research universities.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>We’ve continued to work with CIRTL to provide development and UX support even after the  end of the initial grant project. In May of 2017, there was a concern that the traffic around the resources section of the website was lower than expected. In December 2017 we deployed a major redesign to the website to address this issue and to improve web accessibility around the platform. <strong>This case study will focus on that effort.</strong></p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We conducted several meetings with the CIRTL admin team to understand concerns based on tickets received via Intercom and their own experience using the website. From there I read through the Intercom tickets and reached out the a few users who submitted an issue related to the resources.</p>
    <p>Based on the research we found that users had little problems finding a resource when they knew exactly what they wanted but there was little to no incentive or easy way to explore the vast library of resources through the UI.  So we decided to test the concept of  “Resource Collections” where the CIRTL Admin team could group resources together into a named collection and see if that provided enough incentive to stick around and explore the resources. 
    </p>
    <p>Once we had our hypothesis I created a flowchart.</p>

      <div class="caption__description">From the discussion with the development team we realized that we were already collecting resource tags when users uploaded a resource to the site. So we added a “Topics” page where we listed in alphabetical order all the topics used for tagging resources</div>

    <h2>Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
    <p>I started with some sketches to find a consistent layout that worked with all the different screens listed in the flowchart.</p>

    <h2>Highlight</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite pieces from this project is the 404 page. I wanted to capture that feeling of walking into the wrong classroom when you accidently take a wrong turn on the website.</p>
