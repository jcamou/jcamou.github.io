    <p>Sixth Edge had the opportunity to work with the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) through a grant awarded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to build a platform for a network of 25 Universities around North America. The platform provided a place to share resources, create learning communities, and offer courses to current and future STEM faculty committed to advancing evidence-based teaching practices. Since the initial grant, the Network has expanded to more than 40 research universities.</p>

    <p>We’ve continued to work with CIRTL to provide development and UX support even after the end of the initial grant project. In May of 2017, there was concern that traffic around the resource section of the website was lower than expected. This was a big deal since resources - e.g., research papers, posters, guidebooks, etc.. - were one of the main things the network offered their members. So we took a look to see what was keeping people away.</p>

    <p class="spacing__margin-bottom--1">After meeting with the CIRTL Admin team to hear about their own experiences with the website, we took a look at tickets received via Intercom. From there I reached out to a few users who submitted an issue related to the resources to understand it from their perspective.  What we learned was that:</p>
    <ul class="basic-list">
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">The resource section did not give users enough direction or incentive to explore.</li>
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Users were only using resources when they knew exactly what they needed.</li>
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Support articles were found within resources adding to the confusion.</li>

    <ul class="basic-list">
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Give users a more guided experience around the resources.</li>
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Add better ways to search for resources.</li>
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Separate and distinguish support resources from research resources.</li>

    <div class="text--ui text__font-sze--14 text__color--blue spacing__margin-bottom--1">Complexity with little support</div>
    <p>The first issue we wanted to tackle was the lack of direction within the resource section. Users should have some incentive to explore resources. A department store doesn’t just throw you in their inventory warehouse and expect you to have a good experience. They place interesting and relevant pieces in front of you to give ideas of what you might want.</p>
    <p>So with that in mind, we decided to test the concept of “Resource Collections” where the CIRTL Admin team could group resources into a named collection and feature them on the Resources page.</p>
    <p>Once we had a hypothesis to test, I created a flowchart to see how everything would fit together and what would go into each section. In discussing the flowchart with the developers, we realized that each resource contained a set of tags. These tags weren’t used for anything else other than to tag resources as users uploaded them to the site. So we decided to take advantage of that and create a Topics page that listed all the tags in alphabetical order, so users had another way of exploring. From there I moved on to some sketching to figure out the layout before moving on to a high-fidelity prototype.</p>
    <p>To address the issue of support articles intermingling with network resources,  we created a section specifically for the support articles and called it “Guides.” We placed that link above the navigation to indicate that “Guides” was a global item encompassing all the items within the navigation or that was the intent. More on that later.</p>

    <div class="text--ui text__font-sze--14 text__color--blue spacing__margin-bottom--1">Complexity with little support</div>
    <p>Then came time to test with some actual users. We conducted remote usability tests to validate the Resource Collection concept and see if there was any change in the experience with resources.</p>

  <div class="col__6--center col-small__10--center">
    <p>We tested five people across both versions. Tasks were designed to encourage exploration, putting participants in scenarios where they were interested in specific topics or research areas and seeing how they went about finding resources related to that. To measure the overall usability of each version, we administered a SUS Questionnaire. The SUS score for the current CIRTL site was 55.5 out of 100. The SUS score for the new design was eleven points higher at 66.5.</p>
    <p>Overall, users had a positive reaction to the new design. Resource Collections were used as intended. Participants would explore the collections before scrolling down to the individual resource list. One participant even saved a resource she came across in one of the collections!</p>
    <p class="spacing__margin-bottom--1">The main issues we came across in the new design were:</p>
    <ul class="basic-list">
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Confusion over semantics - e.g., Resources vs. Guides.</li>
      <li class="basic-list__item spacing__margin-bottom--1">Links above the navigation were complete ignored causing a couple of participants to struggle with tasks related to the support guides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To address these two issues we renamed “Guides” to “Support Guides” to offer a more precise description, and we moved it to the navigation bar. Obvious in hindsight, but that’s the beauty of usability testing.</p>

    <p>At the start of this project, we set out to turn the Network Resources into an enjoyable experience where users could explore without having a set item in mind. By adding Resource Collections and Topics to the website, we gave users a way to browse through the library. Resource Collections shipped in December 2017 and are currently in use on CIRTL.net.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite pieces from this project is the 404 page, which is hopefully rarely seen. I wanted to capture the feeling of walking into the wrong classroom when you accidentally take a wrong turn on the website. I’m sure many can relate. </p>
