    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>TBL is a teaching methodology that shifts the teacher’s role from an instructor to more of a course facilitator. The instructor forgoes the traditional lecture for TBL activities that encourage teams to discuss topics amongst themselves and receive timely feedback to make sure they stay on track. With that shift comes hours of planning, gathering and distributing materials, monitoring team discussions, and the ability to give quick feedback to keep students engaged.</p>
    <p>We noticed that there was no centralized solution that helped implement TBL in a classroom. Instructors were trying to piece together many different web apps to keep their courses organized. So we decided to see if there was an opportunity for a full TBL web application.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I was responsible for compiling a list of user requirements and designing the user experience based on user data. I also tested and styled the platform based on my designs using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>My main goal was to find similarities between the different implementations of TBL by the instructors to design a system that works for all.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We interviewed members of the Iowa State University’s TBL Faculty Learning Community to understand the scope of a tool that meets all the TBL needs. We also had the opportunity to interview leaders in the TBL field to get their buy in for the tool.</p>
    
    <p>Through the interviews we were able to validate the need of a full TBL solution and gather enough requirements to prioritize functionality and create a flowchart. This helped facilitate the discussion between the developers and myself.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>I conducted a focus group test with the TBL Learning Community to spot the obvious mistakes, make sure the design was going in the right direction, and iterate.</p>
    <p>Once the mockups were updated, I conducted remote usability tests using Zoom, Invision, and Google Forms. Tasks focused on creating different types of exercises and managing their teams. </p>

    <p>I went through a couple of iterations of the OpenTBL logo. The final icon is in accordance to TBL literature which states that five students is the perfect team size. The star in the middle is the outcome of those five minds working together. </p>
