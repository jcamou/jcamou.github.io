    <p class="spacing__margin-bottom--2">After adding a <a>Team-based Learning (TBL)</a> feature to ThinkSpace, one of our learning platforms, we noticed an unusual increase in tickets regarding the exercise builder. ThinkSpace housed a variety of discipline-specific tools that could be added to any exercise, so complexity wasn’t unfamiliar to its users. However, given that this tool was the first one to add team functionality to the platform compounded with the number of tickets coming in, we decided to take a closer look at the problem. </p>

    <p>The result was OpenTBL, a learning platform designed specifically for TBL, containing a simplified exercise builder and support articles.</p>

    <p class="spacing__margin-bottom--2">The majority of the problems stemmed from the number of disciplines and learning tools ThinkSpace catered to. This is a strength of the platform when building more complicated exercises, but can be brutal for someone building something as simple as a Peer Evaluation. Too many options, too many steps, and too many opportunities to get lost. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h3>What is Team-Based Learning?</h3>
    <p>TBL is a teaching methodology that shifts the teacher’s role from an instructor to more of a course facilitator. The instructor forgoes the traditional lecture for TBL activities that encourage teams to discuss topics amongst themselves and receive timely feedback to make sure they stay on track. With that shift comes hours of planning, gathering and distributing materials, monitoring team discussions, and the ability to give quick feedback to keep students engaged.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>We noticed a void when it came to a centralized solution to help implement TBL in a classroom. Instructors were trying to piece together different web apps, like Google Docs and spreadsheets, to create an online TBL environment but keeping it all organized proved to be overwhelming. So we decided to see if there was an opportunity for a full TBL web application.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>I was responsible for compiling a list of requirements from user research and designing the user experience. I also tested and styled the platform based on my designs using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My primary goal was to find similarities between the different implementations of TBL by the instructors to design a system that works for all.</p>
    <p>To start off, we read through foundational Team-Based Learning literature to understand the theory. We then interviewed members of the Iowa State University’s TBL Faculty Learning Community to understand TBL at a practical level and gauge the scope of a tool that meets all the TBL needs. We also had the opportunity to interview leaders in the TBL field to hear what they’d see as the “perfect” TBL tool.
    </p>
    
    <p>Through the interviews, we were able to validate the need for a full TBL solution. We gathered enough requirements to prioritize functionality and create a user flowchart which helped facilitate the discussion between the developers and myself.</p>

    <h2>Sketching & Mockups</h2>
    <p>I started with some initial sketches implementing the critical screens from the flowchart to get an idea of the layout. We focused the bulk of the brainstorming around the concept of “The Builder.” We wanted the process of creating an exercise to be as quick and effortless as possible.</p>

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p>I conducted a focus group test with the TBL Learning Community to spot the glaring mistakes, make sure the designs were going in the right direction. The TBL Learning Community was a huge help here. They were supportive, critical, and most of all excited about the designs, which was a huge motivator for us!
    </p>
    <p>Once the mockups were updated based on the group feedback, I conducted remote usability tests using Zoom, InVision, and Google Forms. Tasks focused on creating different types of exercises and managing their teams.</p>

    <h2>Release</h2>
    <p>OpenTBL was released Fall 2017 after a summer course pilot test that resulted in positive reviews. It is currently being used campus-wide at Iowa State University.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>OpenTBL was a big lesson in Marketing. We had a product, we had some users, but we hadn’t baked in any marketing or business methods to the product itself. Things like drip email campaigns to keep users engaged and educated about some of the less-obvious features were missing. The lack of marking methods resulted and a lot of late nights reading marketing 101 posts and listening to podcasts. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/category/podcast/">Intercom’s Inside Intercom Podcast</a> is a great resource.</p>
